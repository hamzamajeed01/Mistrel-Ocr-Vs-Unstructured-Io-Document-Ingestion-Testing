# Plaintiff's Counsel: Can you briefly describe the key components of the IIPP?

Plaintiff's Counsel: Can you provide more detail about the inspection process that was carried out on the morning of the incident?

Herman Bogie: Sure. Every morning, before the fair opens, our safety officers conduct a comprehensive walk-through of the entire fairgrounds. They use a detailed checklist to identify any potential hazards. These checklists are then submitted to me for review and filed for recordkeeping.

Plaintiff's Counsel: Did you personally review the inspection report from the morning of January 23, 2024?

Herman Bogie: Yes, I did. I review all inspection reports daily to ensure that any identified hazards are addressed immediately.

Plaintiff's Counsel: If a hazard had been identified, what would the procedure have been to address it?

Herman Bogie: If a hazard is identified, it is marked immediately, and the necessary remediation steps are taken as soon as possible. The action taken is then documented in a followup report.

Plaintiff's Counsel: Thank you. In the aftermath of the incident involving John Doe, did anyone report that Mr. Doe had been acting drunk?

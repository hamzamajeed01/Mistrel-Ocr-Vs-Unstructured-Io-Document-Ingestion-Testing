Defendants' Counsel: Good morning, Mr. Doe. My name is Robert Brown, and I represent Sierra County and Fairs Are Us in this matter. Could you please state your full name and address for the record?

John Doe: Sure. My name is John Doe, and I live at 123 Elm Street, Anytown, USA.
Defendants' Counsel: Thank you. Mr. Doe, could you please describe your occupation?
John Doe: I'm a construction worker.
Defendants' Counsel: And how long have you been working in that field?
John Doe: For about 20 years now.
Defendants' Counsel: Let's talk about the incident on January 23, 2024. Can you describe what happened that day?

John Doe: Yes. I was at the Sierra County Fair with my two daughters, who are nine years old, and a couple of my co-workers. We were leaving the Tilt-A-Whirl ride when I tripped over a spike that was sticking out of the ground in the exit path.

Defendants' Counsel: What time did this incident occur?
John Doe: It was around 3:00 PM.
Defendants' Counsel: Can you describe the spike you tripped over?
John Doe: It was a metal spike, maybe about four inches high, sticking out of the ground. It was right in the path where people were exiting the ride.

Defendants' Counsel: What happened immediately after you tripped?
John Doe: I fell and landed awkwardly on my left ankle. I felt a sharp pain and couldn't stand up. I also felt pain in my back and neck.

Defendants' Counsel: Did anyone come to assist you?
John Doe: Yes, my co-workers and a fair staff member came over. They called for medical help, and I was taken to Sierra Vista Medical Center.

Defendants' Counsel: What kind of treatment did you receive at the medical center?
John Doe: They did some X-rays and found that I had a broken left ankle. I needed immediate surgery. They also noted that I had back spasms and a neck strain.

Defendants' Counsel: How long were you in the hospital?
John Doe: I was there for three days.
Defendants' Counsel: Are you currently receiving any treatment?
John Doe: Yes, I'm undergoing physical therapy for my ankle, and I'm also seeing a chiropractor for my back and neck.

Defendants' Counsel: How has this injury affected your ability to work?
John Doe: I can't return to my job as a construction worker. My doctor hasn't given me a timeline for when I might be able to go back to work.

Defendants' Counsel: Are you seeking compensation for lost wages?
John Doe: Yes, I am. I'm also seeking compensation for general damages, loss of household services, and other related expenses.

Defendants' Counsel: Mr. Doe, have you experienced any other impacts on your daily life due to this injury?

John Doe: Yes, I can't do many of the household chores I used to do, and I can't play with my daughters the way I used to. It's been very difficult.

Defendants' Counsel: Thank you, Mr. Doe. I need to ask you about your activities at the fair. Did you consume any alcohol that day?

John Doe: Yes, I did. I had four beers.
Defendants' Counsel: Over what period of time did you consume these beers?

John Doe: Over the course of about two hours.
Defendants' Counsel: Do you believe the alcohol affected your ability to safely navigate the fairgrounds?

John Doe: No, I felt fine and in control.
Defendants' Counsel: Did you notice the spike or any other unsafe conditions before you tripped?

John Doe: No, I didn't see the spike until I tripped over it. I wasn't looking for hazards specifically, but I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary before the accident.

Defendants' Counsel: Did you use the Tilt-A-Whirl ride before the incident?
John Doe: Yes, I went on the ride with my daughters.
Defendants' Counsel: Did you notice the spike or any other unsafe conditions while using the Tilt-A-Whirl or in the exit path before you tripped?

John Doe: No, I did not notice anything unusual when we got off the ride. It wasn't until I tripped that I saw the spike.

Defendants' Counsel: Thank you, Mr. Doe. I have no further questions at this time.
Plaintiff's Counsel: I have a few questions, Mr. Doe. Can you describe the condition of the fairgrounds on the day of the incident?

John Doe: The fairgrounds were crowded, and there were a lot of people around. The exit path from the ride was pretty narrow, and I didn't see the spike until it was too late.

Plaintiff's Counsel: Had you noticed any other hazards at the fair that day?
John Doe: No, I didn't notice anything else out of the ordinary.
Plaintiff's Counsel: Thank you, Mr. Doe. That's all I have.
Court Reporter: The deposition is concluded at 11:00 AM.
